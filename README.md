This is a group chat application designed for my computer communication course in my master's program.

To run this program, follow these steps:

Execute the commands make clean ; make to compile the program.

Start the server using ./cserverd with the desired local IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) and port number (e.g., 5000). Example: ./cserverd 127.0.0.1:5000

Launch the client ./cchat with the server's IP address, server port, and your chosen nickname. Example: ./cchat 127.0.0.1 5000 ajettesla"
